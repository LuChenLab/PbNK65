# Transcriptomic Profiling of *Plasmodium*-Induced Lung Pathology

This repository accompanies a study investigating the immune mechanisms underlying **Plasmodium-induced lung injury**, with a particular focus on the role of **IFN-γ signaling in T cells** and its impact on **T cell–monocyte interactions** and pulmonary pathology.

Key approaches:  
- **Bulk RNA-seq** and **spatial transcriptomics** performed on a murine *Plasmodium* lung infection model to map the temporal and spatial dynamics of immune responses.  
- **scRNA-seq** from a MA-ARDS model used to validate immune cell subsets and regulatory interactions.

The datasets provided enable a comprehensive, multi-dimensional exploration of the host immune landscape during *Plasmodium* infection.
